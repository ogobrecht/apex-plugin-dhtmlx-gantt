How to start
------------

- check our how-to-start tutorials https://docs.dhtmlx.com/gantt/desktop__howtostart_guides.html
- explore code samples https://docs.dhtmlx.com/gantt/samples/


How to run samples
------------

All the samples except for a few that explicitly require a REST backend api can be opened as static files.

Running the backend:

- `npm install` or `yarn install`
- `npm start` or `yarn start`
- go to `http://localhost:9200`

or

- copy `codebase` and `samples` folders of the package to your Apache/nginx directory and open samples as static html pages. Demos that require RESTful backend will not work in that case.

Package structure
------------

- ./codebase - css and javascript files of the library
- ./samples - code samples
- ./backend - a simple node backend to run samples
